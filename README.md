nvim config!

To use this configuration, you can do the following:
1. If you haven't already, install Neovim: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md
2. Make or navigate to the \~/.config/ folder (\~/AppData/Local/ on Windows): https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#config
3. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Vassily-Petrousevitch/nvim`

Make sure the resultant file path is ~/.config/nvim or Windows equivalent (NOTE: if you changed $XDG_CONFIG, you are on your own with finding the correct file path) 

4. Run Neovim: `nvim`
